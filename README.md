Blood group determination is a critical step in medical procedures, particularly in transfusions and emergency care. Traditional methods require invasive sampling, causing discomfort and posing risks such as infection. This project aims to develop a non-invasive approach to detect blood groups using spectral imaging technology.
Spectral imaging combines spectroscopy and imaging to capture the interaction of light with biological tissues in blood such as blood molecules, WBC, RBC and other molecules. Each blood group exhibits unique optical properties due to differences in antigenic compositions, which can be identified by analyzing reflected, absorbed, or scattered light in specific wavelength ranges. That is each blood group will have different spectral signatures. Based on this spectral signature we trained our model to predict the blood group of an individual.â€¯
